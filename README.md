## Yoshinapp
Yoshinapp is a cross-platform mobile application that aims to provide a way to learn the Japanese language. It has been developed to offer a clean and pleasant interface to boost learning efficiency.

## Why develop an app that already exists in millions of forms ?
This project is for me the opportunity to develop my skills in mobile programming while working on a subject that means a lot to me: the Japanese language.
I don't pretend to bring a revolution, my goal is to provide a completely FREE support that will help people who are looking for learning Japanese. As for now, the project is still in its early phase but I hope to see the application grow significantly in the future by taking advantage of game-changing features.

## Where does the name come from ?
The name is a combination of two terms: Yoshino and App. Yoshino is the name of a variety of Japanese cherry tree which is widely known and spread nowadays. As you can see, the application uses colors that remind of cherry trees with their famous flowers.
